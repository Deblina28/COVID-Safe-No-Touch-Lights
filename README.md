# COVID-Safe-No-Touch-Lights
In this project, with detecting claps, we switch different elements. The circuit is a sequence detector that detects a series of claps and performs a task. Here we are lighting series of LEDs that will refer to those tasks. By changing these LEDs and placing a relay instead, we can switch room appliances and High voltage appliances. For this prototype you can, with one clap - turn the red light on, with three claps - turn the green lights on and finally with two claps - all the lights switches off.
