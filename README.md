# COVID-Safe-No-Touch-Lights
In this project, with detecting claps, we switch different elements. The circuit is a sequence detector that detects a series of claps and performs a task. Here we are lighting series of LEDs that will refer to those tasks. By changing these LEDs and placing a relay instead, we can switch room appliances and High voltage appliances. For this prototype you can, with one clap - turn the red light on, with three claps - turn the green lights on and finally with two claps - all the lights switches off.

Further we are planning to use pattern recognising of the claps. This can be done by storing the samples in an array which can be stored in a SRAM, outside the microcontroller. Then using algorithms to perform the matching pattern by using bias and concluding the confidence of a decesion.
